<h2>Symptoms</h2>Initial symptoms appear as small purple-red or tan spots on both upper and lower surfaces of the lower leaves. These spots enlarge to form raised pustules that rupture to release masses of reddish-brown spores. The pustules spread to all leaves and may also be found on the leaf sheaths ,stem.

<h5>Management</h5><ul>
  <li>The application of fungicides can be beneficial when used on susceptible varieties. Products based on hexaconazole (0.1%), difenconazole (0.1 %) and propiconazole (0.1 %) can be used to control the disease. Two sprays of these fungicides at 15 days interval immediately after appearance of symptoms is recommended.</li>
  <li> use resistant varieties like RSV2383,RSV2390,RSV2393,RSV2394,RSV2395.</li>
<li>Spray Mancozeb at 1kg/ha. Repeat fungicidal application after 10 days</li>
